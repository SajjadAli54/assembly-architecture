Architecture
    * The art of practice of designing the constructing building
    * The complex or carefully designed structure of something

Factors Affecting the performance of the computer

    * Micro Processor
    * Memory
    * Bus (Group of wires to transfer data)
    * I/O Modules
    * Operating System and Derivers

Instruction Set ----->    Collection of Instructions
    * Logical Instructions      cin, string, int etc.
    * Physical Instructions     The machine code representing the Logical Instructions

Architecture and Organization
    Architecture                                Organization

    * It is frontend engineering.               * It is backend engineering.
    * Those attributes which are visible        * It is How features are implemented.
      to the programmer.                          Control Signals, interfaces, Memory technology etc.
      Instruction set, number of bits             e.g. Is there a hardware multiply unit or is it done by repititive addition?
      used for data transfer etc.
      e.g. Is there a multiply Instruction?

Structure and Function
    * Structure is the way in which components relate to each other.
    * Function is the operation of individual components as part of the structure
        * All Computer functions are:
            * Data Processing   ---> Process the data, execute it to perform some specific operations
            * Data Storage      ---> Store or capture the data in Memory
            * Data Movement     ---> Data Transfer between components
            * Control           ---> Identify what operations to perform on data
