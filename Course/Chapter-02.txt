Von Neuman Architecture (IAS Computer)
    
    * Principles
        * Single memory can hold data and instructions simultaneously (Stored Program Concept).
        * Memory will be segmented with appropriate address to each segment.
        * Programs will be executed sequentially.
    * Structure
        * CA (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) 
        * CC (Central Control or Control Unit)
        * M (Memory)
        * R (Outside Record medium of the device)
        * I (Input)
        * O (Output)

    * Registers
        * Memory Buffer Register (MBR)
            * Contains a word to be 
                * stored in memory 
                * sent to the I/O unit 
                * used to receive a word from memory or from the I/O unit.
        * Memory address Register (MAR)
            * Specifies the address in memory of the word to be written from or read into the MBR.
        * Instruction Register (IR)
            * Contains the 8 bit opcode of instruction to be executed 
        * Instruction Buffer Register (IBR)
            * Employed to hold the temporarily the right-hand instruction from a word in memory
        * Program Counter (PC)
            * Contains the address of the next instruction pair to be fetched from memory
        * Accumulator (AC) and Multiplier Quotient(MQ)
            * Employed to hold temporarily operands and results of ALU operations. For example, the result of
            multiplying two 4-bit numbers is an 8-bit number; the most significant 4 bits
            are stored in the AC and the least significant in the MQ.

Pipelining

    * 5 stage Pipelining
        * Fetch      ---> It fetches the instructions
        * Decode     ---> It decodes the instruction to machine code
        * Fetch data ---> It fetches the data from any medium(if any).
        * Execute    ---> It executes the instructions
        * Store      ---> It stores the result of execution in memory(if any).

    * 3 stage Pipelining
        * Fetch
        * Decode
        * Execute

Branch Instructions
    * These are the instructions which changes the normal flow of Program
        * Loops
        * If statements
        * Unconditional Branches
        * Methods and Functions
